		<h1>Foundation Troubles</h1>
		<p>A designer friend of mine, drunk on good beer and righteousness, decided to bash foundation to me the other day.He said they keep rebuilding themselves every month screwing over their userbase.

		<h2>Friend in trouble</h2>
		<p>
			We never thought of findin' a place where we belong. Don't have to stand alone, we'll never let you fall. Don't need permission to decide what you believe. You gotta learn something when we meet you after school. I said jump, down on Jump Street. I said jump, down on Jump Street. Your friends will be there when your back is to the wall. You'll find you'll need us cause there's no one else to call. When it was hopeless a decision is what you need. You'd better be ready cause' your runnin' outta time. Say jump, 21 Jump, Street.

			You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life, the facts of life. There's a time you got to go and show you're growin' now you know about the facts of life, the facts of life. When the world never seems to be livin up to your dreams and suddenly you're finding out the facts of life are all about you.

			Hey you guys! We're gonna turn it on, we're gonna bring you the power! We're gonna light the dark of night like the brightest day in a whole new way! We're gonna turn it on, we're gonna bring you the power! We're gonna tell you the truest words that you heard anybody say! Moving out in a new way, moving out in a new way! We're gonna turn it on, we're gonna bring you the power! It's coming down the lines, strong as they can be, through the courtesy of the Electric Company, the Electric Company!

		<h3>Are you ready for the truth?</h3>
		<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. <br>Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>
